"remark","Description"
1,"Work not in construction (hiking path maintenance) but task judged meaningful"
2,"Even though the article concludes that low exposure values may be related to wet ground, it is stated that it rained only on the morning of the first day. Rain was not retained as a factor"
3,"General environment"
4,"Environment at the walkway at the oven level"
5,"Polish language article. Information extracted from bilingual tables and abstract"
6,"On-off work on the rock face by 2 chipping hammers during the first 80 minutes of sampling"
7,"Dry-material storage on 2nd floor"
8,"Certain bits of information come from reference ID0793"
9,"High and quick flow of automobile traffic in tunnel"
10,"More dust than at the drilling machine because sampling was done by the chipping hammer under the scaffolding"
11,"Enclosed scaffolding"
12,"Restricted space: work was done in an old restaurant but the room was sealed with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of other areas"
13,"Fine particulates more numerous than in previous sample for less weight"
14,"Strong heat"
15,"Concentration measured outside of RPE"
16,"Concentration measured inside of RPE"
17,"The important concentration of cristobalite is probably associated with the drilling of the brick material"
18,"The electrical cutting tool was equipped with a resin wheel of 230 mm"
19,"The breaking down and transport of debris on conveyor is probably the main source of dust"
20,"Lack of details on analytical methods is understandable since the document is a Powerpoint presentation givent at AIHCE 2000"
21,"The % of quartz in the bulk material comes from the supplier MSDS"
22,"The area sample was taken downwind from the drilling operation"
23,"The area sample was taken upwind from the drilling operation"
24,"The work area is a scaffolding on a building side enclosed in plastic sheeting"
25,"The use of water spraying could be acceptable with a pneumatic driven grinder"
26,"Even if the work was done outside (boat locks) the authors estimate the depth sufficient (33  m) to classify as a confined space"
27,"MVUE = minimum-variance unbiased estimator"
28,"Closure defective. On the transfer grounds, non on his runs; 7 cycles during sampling"
29,"Continuous sampling including breaks (lunch excluded)"
30,"Area samples done upwind of sources"
31,"Personal sampling"
32,"Sampling done under hood"
33,"Sanding operator in open bay, 15 m from sampling head on average"
34,"Endures the dust generated by the other 2 chipping hammers"
35,"Tunnel drilling (5 m diameter) with TBM"
36,"Second sample done because dust levels vary strongly with wind direction"
37,"A worker (filling holes with putty) without a mask beside sampling head"
38,"Transfer zone of small rocks by wheelbarrow"
